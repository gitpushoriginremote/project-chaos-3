# Project Chaos - Phase 0

Internal tool for monitoring environmental entropy and system instability.

## Known Anomalies (Bugs to Fix):
1. **Layout Fracture**: The Chaos Meter in the navbar is pushing the layout wide, causing a horizontal scrollbar. It needs to be responsive.
2. **Logic Void**: The 'Log Anomaly' form prints to the console but doesn't update the 'Incident Stream' on the page.
3. **Feature Gap**: The Entropy Level is static. It should fluctuate or increase as more incidents are logged.

## Tech Stack
- Pure HTML5
- CSS3 (System CSS Variables)
- Vanilla JS
